This is a quick guide to getting started with ``saspt``. For a more detailed 
explanation of the purpose of the package, see :ref:`description_label`.

``saspt`` comes with a small toy set of trajectories that we'll use for these
examples:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from saspt import sample_detections
    >>> detections = sample_detections()
    >>> print(detections)
